# form-signup

## Before project:

Another day another dolla. Ok so there was a lot of background reading to do before this project so while my html and css should be pretty good around about now, i dont think its really up to scratch just yet. It's fine though I know where to find things and after this is done I hope to have a bettter idea of styleing with css and creating forms of course with html. Yeah I'd like to work on my css formatting so its a bit neater and also just to practice positioning divs etc. so I can get faster at it because currently I just do trial and errror until the element is in the right place which isnt inherently terrible but I'd rather know what to do and then be surprised when the element is positioned incorrectly ratheer than vice versa.
